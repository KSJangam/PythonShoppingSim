PythonShoppingSim

This projects simulated a shopping simulator where the user could login as an admin or as a customer.

As an admin, the user can:
1. Add a product to the list of purchaseable items
2. View the list of purchaseable items
3. Edit a product's price
4. Remove a product from the list
5. Save their changes
Saving changes would write the list to a csv file where it would be read from when a user logs in.

As a customer, the user can:
1. Add a quanitity of an item to their cart
2. View their cart
3. Remove a quantity of an item from their cart

This project used several python concepts.
1. Getting user input
2. Using try-except statements to make sure the user input was valid
3. Using the put, get, and keyset functionalities of dictionaries
4. Formatting Strings with variables
5. Iterating through dictionaries using for loops
6. Using a while loop to continuously ask the user to choose an action until they decide to quit
7. Reading and writing to and from csv files
